Completely scientifical project

# About

Scorpion is an scientifical and data handler multi-programming language project that includes essential functions for your projects, researches or scripts.

## Includes
- Data handling (included matrix)
- Scientical functions (sqrt, degrees, radians, etc...)
- Scientifcal operations (factorization, finding factorization, sin, cos, tan, etc...)
